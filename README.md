 1.1 (Unreleased)
 
    [FIXED] Mogun says a line that makes no sense if Hogun dies in Saga 1

 1.0 
 
    [FIXED] Ranged abilities being capped off by Exertion. So for instance Gunnulf can't use Rank 3 of Forge Ahead and Sparr cannot use max-range Insult if they only have 2 EXE.
    [FIXED] Survival finale cutscene and final scores not triggering properly

INSTALLATION:
    Just uncompress the .zip in your "../steamapps/common" folder. It will ask you to overwrite some files, it's all right! The archive comes with backups just in case! (the ones with a .orig extension).
UNINSTALLATION:
    Just delete the files and rename the backups OR verify the integrity of game files in Steam.
